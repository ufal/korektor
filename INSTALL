  (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MinGW/Extension/make/make-3.82-mingw32/)



Compilation
===========

To compile Korektor, run make in the src directory.

Make targets and options:
- exe: compile the binaries (default)
- lib: compile the static library
- BITS=32 or BITS=64: compile for specified 32-bit or 64-bit architecture
  instead of the default one
- mode=RELEASE: create release build which statically links the C++ runtime and
  uses LTO
- mode=DEBUG: create debug build
- mode=PROFILE: create profile build

- PLATFORM=osx, PLATFORM=osx-clang: clang compiler on OS X, default on OS X;
  BITS=32+64 enables multiarch build
- PLATFORM=win, PLATFORM=win-gcc: gcc compiler on Windows (TDM-GCC is well
  tested), default on Windows
- PLATFORM=win-vs: Visual C++ 2013 compiler on Windows, must be selected
  manually; note that the cl.exe compiler must be already present in PATH and
